Welcome to my site!

I am Jun Yu Tan (my first name is Jun Yu). I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Data Science & Analytics, and I'm passionate about harnessing the power of analytics to build models, generate actionable insights, or just understand our world better.

Previously, I was a data science intern at [eyos](https://eyos.one/) (a retail analytics platform), followed by a short stint in technology consulting at [EY Data & Analytics](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/big-data-analytics). I also interned at [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/) as a data analyst, where I maintained big data workflows, created dashboards, and optimized computational resources with machine learning. Towards the end of my degree, I undertook an industrial attachment with [Micron](https://www.micron.com/) to research and deploy advanced analytics solutions for novelty detection with industrial IoT. I currently work as an analytics engineer in the consumer internet industry. 

Here, I discuss ideas and experiences I've learned or explored, and my interests generally lie in machine learning and statistics.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tanjy) or reach out to me via [email](mailto:jy8230@gmail.com).
