Welcome to my site!

I am Jun Yu Tan, a final year student pursuing Data Science & Analytics at the National University of Singapore. I'm passionate about harnessing the power of data to build models, perform analyses and generate actionable insights.

Here, I discuss recent ideas and experiences I've learned or explored.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tanjy) or reach out to me via [email](mailto:jy8230@gmail.com).
