Welcome to my site!

I am Jun Yu Tan (my first name is Jun Yu), currently a Machine Learning Engineer at Saleswhale/[6sense](https://6sense.com/) building conversational AI to power automated lead conversion in sales and marketing teams.

I graduated from the National University of Singapore with a degree in Data Science & Analytics, and I'm passionate about building great products and harnessing AI to make the world a better place.

Previously, I also did data science / machine learning work with [eyos](https://eyos.one/) (a retail analytics platform), [EY Data & Analytics](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/big-data-analytics), [Autodesk](https://www.autodesk.com/), and [Micron](https://www.micron.com/).

Here, I discuss ideas and experiences I've learned or explored, and my interests generally lie in machine learning, engineering, and entrepreneurship.
